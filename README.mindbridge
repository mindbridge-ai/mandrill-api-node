Forked from https://bitbucket.org/mailchimp/mandrill-api-node to switch
from `https` to `request` for proxy support.

Latest release was 1.0.45.

package.json says 1.0.42, I believe this is an error introduced by a pull
request they merged after the 1.0.45 release, and can be ignored.

Building: Edit the .coffee file and then `npm run build`.
